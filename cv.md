### About Myself

I'd describe my priorities with words of a song. I want to love what I do and do what I love. Programming so far is exciting. Also it is overwhelming, but still exciting.

I am a sociable and open person. I love traveling, meeting new people. Also I do volunteer work. I am a member of a local eco-movement. Volunteer work can make a huge difference in the way you see things and the world. 

At the moment, I do not have much experience in programming, mainly my expierience is limited to RSSchool, w3school tutorials and freeCodeCamp. I would very much like to change my current field of work, because it's necessary to go further and develop.
